# Code-Reading-Guide
**The purpose writing the code Reading Guide is to help other developers understand and analyze the Python Project more easily.
Hopefully, it will help you save time, reduce misunderstandings, and facilitate better collaboration.**

# Before Everything
1. for Readers
   
   `model_structure.png` in the corresponding project directory is a skeleton diagram of the model, you can view the file to further familiarize yourself with the project. Don't be completely unaware of our work.

2. for Experimenters and Developers
   
   Please check the corresponding `requirements.txt` and ensure that the necessary third-party Python libraries are installed. And refer to `README.md` file for the instructions on how to run the project. Basically, the names of the methods in the code are consistent with the names of the algorithms used. When developing, please refer to relevant materials to understand the principles of the algorithms.
